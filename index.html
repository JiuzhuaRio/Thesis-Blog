					<h1>Thesis Summer Homework </h1>

					<div class="part-text">
						<p><b>Hi I'm Yufei Zhang</b></p>
						<p>I came from a engineering backgrounp and my focus here at DT is mainly about storytelling and speculative design. I'm more confortable with physcial media like physical computing and fibracation.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="part-text">
						<p><b>Question 1: who is the person going through thesis?</b></p>
						<p>I feel lost since I got into DT program cause I’ve been moving far away from my original goal of becoming an illustrator and feel like I need an update on what kind of person I am right now and what I want to get from the program before I start my thesis.</p>

						<p><b>Question 2: If a project is just designed to be mysterious/weird and can be comprehended by observers in their own way then does is still have meaning?</b></p>
						<p>I know I don’t want to make a project that is just solving existing problem and I like project that are more <i>impractical</i> but I’m still want it to be logical to others instead of just something showing arrogance.</p>

						<p><b>Question 3: Does your old way of design still works for thesis?</b></p>
						<p>Which is came up with some world building/scenario before deciding what domain to work in or what topic to talk about.</p>
						<p><b>Question 4: With basically nothing decided what are the constants?</b></p>
						<ul><li>		Storytelling
						</li><li>	Speculative
						</li><li>	…
						</li></ul>
					</div>

						<p><b>Prototype1: Self-Confrontation</b></p>
						<p>Self-confrontation is a prototype which I entered an enclosure space and face a mirror/self-recording with a notebook for an hour. I write down questions of what I want to know about myself and ask myself to answer it. It’s not the domain I want my thesis to be about but it’s the progress I feel like I need before getting into thesis.</p>

						<p><b>Prototype2: Quintuplets</b></p>
						<p>Quintuplets is a prototype which I made a *meta* image without a propose in design and without a name. And then I try to interpret the image in five different ways and name the image after it.</p>
