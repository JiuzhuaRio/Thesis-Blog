					<h1>Week 5 Reflection</h1>
					<div class="part-text">
						<h3>What happened last week…</h3>
						<p>TBH I wasn’t very productive this week cause I got flu… I’m now three days behind my timeline schedule and I’’ try my best to catch up!</p>
						<p>I did a lot of writing this week though and even though there are no major break through it’s really helpful to write things down and deciding on things.</p>

						<hr>

						<h3>Motivation: What motivates this work? Why this line of inquiry? What values guide your work?</h3>
						<p>My motivation for this work is the combination of my eagerness in telling a story, my love in world-building and my interest in technological development within the different speculative world.</p>
						<p>I created rules for my thesis that need to be followed during the making process:</p>
						<ul><li>It’s a project made for me. But it’s still designed to invoke specific emotion or thinking.
						</li><li>It should be designed with a clearly defined concept/question.
						</li><li>It should be a project of storytelling.
						</li><li>It should be a project of world-building.
						</li><li>It shouldn’t be showing up as a confident answer of any kind.
						</li><li>The core mechanism of the project should not just be “interaction trigger media” mechanism.
						</li><li>It should be able to invoke some emotion from the audience without any explanation other than the project itself.
						</li><li>It should be interesting and made with passion.
						</li><li>It shouldn’t be designed with the idea of using certain kinds of technology.
						</li><li>I should learn whatever knowledge when I need it. No media restrictions.
						</li></ul>

						<hr>

						<h3>Guiding question/ Concept statement: What essential question or idea expresses the purpose of your work? What do you propose to make?</h3>
						<ul><li>What is our technology development based on?
						</li><li>What is the result when we try to combine technology with “dead concept” or concept that is not developing anymore?
						</li><li>How can speculative technology development help understand new technology?
						<ul><li> How to tell a story through a series of world-building?
						</li></ul>
						</li></ul>
						<p>I want to make an exhibition of a collection of objects. Each object reflects on an individual world and a story about the owner of objects will be interspersed within the details of these items. There will be a notebook or a set of videos showing as a document of the details in that specific universe. For each world technology development history is different and focus on one domain. There need to be specific research on each domain and build a detailed speculative world.</p>


						<hr>

						<h3>Intention & Audience: Who is this intended for? What kind of impact do you want to have on your audience? Does it serve a specific need? What do you intend to have them walk away with thinking or feeling?</h3>
						<ul><li>This project is for me. 
						</li><li>But I want this project appreciated by other people who are also interested in storytelling, speculative fiction, technology development, and world-building. 
						</li><li>I want my audience to find my work interesting and novel.
						</li><li>I want this project being appreciated by people who value dedication in details.
						</li><li>I want my audience to feel curious by viewing the showcase and want to go through all the objects to learn more about the story. I hope they feel that the amount of information I provided is not enough and want to learn more or create their world.
						</li></ul>


						<hr>

						<h3>Research: What research have you done thus far? Are there critical discoveries or precedents that have informed your research? What research remains to be done to make this project successful and to make you an expert in the field?</h3>

						<p>The research part if the part that is the most week right now. I plan on researching each domain involved and then build the world around it. But the major research needs to be done is the research on media archeology and technological development history. I think my research will mainly focus on the technological aspect of the domain. </p>

						<hr>

						<h3>Form & Prototypes: What are two-three potential forms this project could take? Do you have the skills needed in these media? What prototypes, sketches have you developed? What has been the feedback thus far? What are your time/knowledge/ production constraints?</h3>

						<p>I want to make an exhibition of a collection of objects. Each object reflects on an individual world and a story about the owner of objects will be interspersed within the details of these items. There will be a notebook or a set of videos showing as a document of the details in that specific universe.</p>
						<p>I plan on doing a 7in7 project making prototype for different worlds. The prototype I already built is a crystal ball for fortune teller in a world where we define witchcraft as the kind of activities that reduce entropy. In this case, the crystal ball is a piece of electronics that can read random noise from around environment and interprets noise into characters. Then the fortune teller can tell the future through the characters shown on the LCD screen. </p>
						<p>I’ll test each prototype on users and get the feedback about how the objects make them feel and what kind of world they think that object is from.</p>

						<hr>

						<h3>Methodology: How do you envision prototyping your idea? How will you go about making your thesis? How will you receive feedback, test, and learn from these iterations?</h3>

						<p>From the idea aspect, I’ll use a paper prototype but also drawing, storyboards, and other storytelling methods to see how users respond to the stories and the worlds I built. And then based on that I’ll keep altering.</p>
						<p>From the technology aspect, I’ll mainly be making prototypes focus on one aspect of the function and try to make it world. A lot of different objects will be made during the process and will require technic of different kinds. I’ll try to master those methods first by make unrelated small objects and then use them in object making.</p>

						<hr>

						<h3>Dialogue: What communities are you most engaged with? Which users, peers, and leaders might you talk to make this project better?</h3>
						<p>I want to look into science fictions and projects that made awesome world-building and try to learn from them. If possible, I want to get in touch with some of the creators and try to get their feedback on my stories and worlds I built.</p>
