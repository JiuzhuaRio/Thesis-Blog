						<h3>Make something:</h3>

						<h3>Make a plan for your secondary research: </h3>
						<p>I think my research divide into three different parts:</p>
						<p>1) About current automated systems:</p>
						<p>This area of research based on what is happenning right now in the area of automated systems as a foundation  to better predict what will happened in the future. I’ll mainly do secondary research on current projects and products on automated systems. And then look into academic papers on the development of automated systems to speculate how much future automated systems will develop and how powerful it will be.</p>
						<p>2) About concept:</p>
						<p>I will go through academic papers on nature and technology to come up my own definition on those concept. This part will be heavily academic and should be the foundation of my thinking on how technology become part of the law of nature.</p>
						<p>3) About future:</p>
						<p>This research area mainly contain what future without human will be like. This research area will mainly based on science fictions. I’ll use those works as reference to brainstorm how human will come to an end, what earth will be like without human and what next intellectual species will be like. Then after I have a general idea on what will happened I’ll turn to related academic papers to find science research that support my idea.</p>

						<h3>Weekly Reflection:</h3>
						<p>1) This week I came up first version of my rules for thesis. This is and will be a working progress and I will keep adding and altering rules until I have a fully decided concept/question. Then I’ll work on all the detail and decide on the final version of rules for my thesis.</p>

						<h3>Rules For Yufei’s Thesis: </h3>
						<ul><li>It should be a project of storytelling.
						</li><li>The core of the project should not just be simple <i>interaction trigger media</i> mechanism.
						</li><li>It should be designed with a clearly defined concept/question.
						</li><li>It shouldn’t be showing up as a confident answer of any kind.
						</li><li>It should be able to invoke some emotion from the audience without any explanation other than the project itself.
						</li><li>It shouldn’t be designed with the idea of using certain kinds of technology. 
						</li><li>Yufei should learn whatever technology when comes in need. No media restrict.
						</li><li>It should be interesting and not easily-predictable.
						</li><li>It should have layers of different depth for different users instead of exposing everything on the surface.
						</li><li>Respect the Audience. Do not assume they will just try to make sense of the project.
						</li></ul>

						<p>2) This week I also did a maid map on what I want to get from DT. I did this map to have a renew version of what getting through DT means to me and what kind of place my thesis project play in this progress. It leads to several questions that need to be answered and I think I’ll leave them for next week. After this map I sorta have a better view on how important my final thesis idea is and how to deal with those <i>dead ideas</i> that surly will come up during the process of thesis making. And now after a clearer way of knowing how to do with the ideas that couldn’t make thesis, I feel more free in deciding on an idea to carry on for at least this month unless a better idea came up.</p>

						<p>3) Here is what I want to do next week:</p>
						<ul><li>I want to have a through mind-map on domain and sub-mind map on the ideas that I find interesting. 
						</li><li>I want to make a list of all the separate ideas and starting to cross them off and separate them into small ideas that is don’t have enough depth to develop into a thesis projects and ideas that are not thought through yet but have potential. 
						</li><li>I want to have the list of thesis ideas down to three next week.
						</li><li>I want to organize all the questions (not research-related) that came up from mind-maps and do another self-confrontation. Depends on how much I answer the questions I’ll make the following plan.
						</li><li>If I haven’t change idea for the next week, make an <i>Elena List</i> on the current topic on nature and technology to brainstorm and coming up with prototype ideas.
						</li></ul>
