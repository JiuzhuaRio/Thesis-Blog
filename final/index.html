						<h3>Presentation</h3>
						<p>This is my last post for this semester and I’m feeling sad :(</p>
						<p>Here is a link for the slides of my final presentation: </p>

						<p>The feedback I got from the final presentation are deadly honest and helpful, but it also really put my evaluation of this project to the ground. The one sentence novel is the most helpful idea. The beginning part of that presentation is my first time testing and the result was not good. The engagement people feel from the tiny part of a story is surly important and what I’ve done so far are clearly not enough. And also the scale of my future project also got mentioned a lot during the feedback. I really like the idea of telling a story of a moment. This makes me rethink my project’s form and how to compact everything into a smaller scale without losing a lot of details. I keep saying this project is for me and I don’t care about other things, but like Anezka said, everything story is about the greater. This “I build this project for myself” idea puts my project in a bubble and lack of destination.  For right now there are so many parts not decided and so many aspects left untouched. It feels like a set of tangled earphone wire dripping with goo and I’m just too afraid to try to open it and organize everything. </p>

						<h3>What to do</h3>
						<p>So I should go through all the opening process during the holiday. So many readings/movies/novels/comics that popped  up during this semester as possible reference, and I should sort them out and try to go through them. </p>
						<p>Then is the one-line novel practice. I think my thesis’ development kinda stop after I came up with the from during midterm. I need to go back to the stage where I know nothing and have to push myself to rethink my thesis and tackle the area I don’t	know about.</p>
						<p>There are just so many things need to be done, which is a fault of me not doing my best this semester. </p>

						<p>I just want to start the redemption soon.</p>

						<h3>What if everything restarts...</h3>
						<p>1) Follow the passion.</p>
						<p>2) Start making stuff.</p>
						<p>3) The thing works in your brain means nothing. Always test early.</p>
